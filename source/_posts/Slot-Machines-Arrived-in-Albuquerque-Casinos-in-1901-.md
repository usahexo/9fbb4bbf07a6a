#  Slot Machines Arrived in Albuquerque Casinos in 1901 

Although the word "slot machine" wasn't used until 1895, the first slot machines actually arrived in Albuquerque casinos in 1901. The Mills Novelty Company of Chicago sent two machines to the Frontier Casino on Central Avenue.

At that time, slot machines were considered a novelty item and were only found in high-end casinos. They were not as popular as they are today and typically took up a lot of space since they were three-reel machines with five spinning drums.

The Mills machines had Liberty Bells on them and people would insert pennies to see if they could get three bells in a row. If they did, they would win the equivalent of $2.50 in today's money.

The first machine to pay out was actually stolen by a man named James Stuart. He took it back to his room at the St Francis Hotel and managed to get it to work. He then went to the casino and cashed out his winnings.

Over the years, slot machines have become more popular and can now be found in most casinos around the country. They are no longer considered a novelty item and can be quite addictive for some people.

#  The First Slot Machine Game Machine Used in a Casino was Liberty Bell 

The first slot machine game machine used in a casino was Liberty Bell, which was invented by Charles Fey in San Francisco in 1895. Fey's machine had three spinning reels with five symbols: hearts, diamonds, spades, horseshoes, and Liberty Bells. The bell was the wild symbol and could substitute for any other symbol to create a winning combination. If a player matched three bells on the payline, they would win the jackpot. Play continued until either the player ran out of coins or hit the jackpot. 

Fey's Liberty Bell machine was an instant hit and quickly spread throughout California. In 1900, Fey started manufacturing his machines in Chicago and they began appearing in casinos throughout the eastern United States. In 1906, a competing company began manufacturing slot machines so Fey came up with a new design that featured fruit symbols instead of playing cards. This design became known as the "one-armed bandit" because of the arm that pulled down on the lever to spin the reels. 

Slot machines continue to be popular to this day and are a staple of casinos around the world.

#  San Francisco's Bay Area Frolics with First Slot Machine Ever Seen 

San Francisco, CA - The Bay Area is in a frolic today with the debut of its first slot machine ever seen. This new attraction is located at the Casino San Francisco and has been drawing in huge crowds since it opened.

The San Francisco Chronicle has more:

"The Casino San Francisco yesterday entered on to the bright field of amusement hitherto monopolized by Eastern resorts, by the introduction of a novel form of gambling, in the shape of an upright slot machine. The little apparatus is now doing a rushing business, both from visitors to the city and from residents. It is described as being very simple. A player drops a nickel into the slot at the top, and then levers cause three drums, each with 18 symbols upon it, to revolve. These symbols are variously colored and grouped in threes, sixes, nines or twelves. If one of these symbols comes opposite a window at the bottom of the machine when the drums stop revolving, the player pulls out the drawer below and finds his nickel doubled."

This new slot machine is said to be very simple to play and has been drawing in huge crowds since it opened at the Casino San Francisco. So if you're looking for some excitement while in San Francisco, be sure to check out this new slot machine!

#  Chicago Gets its First Slot Machine and Things Get a Bit Rowdy

On a recent Thursday night, outside of Kuma's Corner in the Avondale neighborhood of Chicago, a new slot machine was installed. Predictably, given that alcohol was involved, things got a bit rowdy.

Slot machines are nothing new in Illinois, as they're present in casinos across the state. But this is the first time that one has been installed in a standalone business like Kuma's Corner.

The bar's co-owner, Luke Tobias, said that the machine was installed to bring in some extra money. "It's mostly for fun," he said. "But if it makes money too, that's great."

Residents of the Avondale neighborhood seem to be divided on the issue. Some view the slot machine as yet another sign of gentrification and displacement in the area, while others see it as simply another way to have some fun.

In any case, it will be interesting to see how things play out at Kuma's Corner now that there's a slot machine on premises.
