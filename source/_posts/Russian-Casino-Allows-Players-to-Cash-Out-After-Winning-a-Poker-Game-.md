#  Russian Casino Allows Players to Cash Out After Winning a Poker Game 

In a recent development in the Russian gambling market, a casino has announced that it will allow players to cash out their winnings after playing poker. This new policy is a departure from the norm in the Russian gambling market, where casinos typically do not allow players to cash out their winnings until they have left the premises.

The casino making this change is reportedly the Royal Flush Casino in Moscow. The casino's new policy allows players to cash out their winnings as soon as they have been verified by the casino's staff. This policy is likely intended to attract more players to the Royal Flush Casino, as it makes it easier for them to get their money out of the casino quickly.

The Royal Flush Casino is not the only Russian casino to allow players to cash out their winnings after playing poker. The X-Club Casino in Sochi also has a similar policy. However, other casinos in Russia do not have this policy and instead require players to leave the premises before cashing out their winnings.

The development of this new policy by Russian casinos could be a sign that they are feeling pressure from online gambling operators who are beginning to dominate the Russian gambling market. Online gambling operators offer players an opportunity to gamble from anywhere in the world, which gives them an edge over traditional Russian casinos.

Russian casinos may be looking for ways to stay competitive in the face of this growing competition from online operators. Allowing players to cash out their winnings immediately after playing poker is one way that they can try to attract more players to their establishments.

#  Russian Casino Limits Players Who Can Cash Out in a Poker Game 

On July 1, Russian casino operators will be required to limit the amount of cash that poker players can withdraw following a game.

This was put into place by the Russian government in an effort to prevent Russians from cashing out large sums of money and depositing it back into the casino, thus laundering money.

Under the new rule, poker players will be able to withdraw no more than 10,000 rubles (approximately $167) following a game. This limit will apply to all players, regardless of their skill level or how much money they have won or lost.

Casino operators are not happy with this new rule, as it cuts into their profits. However, they are legally required to implement it.

Some Russian poker players are not happy with the limit either. They feel that it is too low and that it will adversely affect their play. They would prefer a limit of 50,000 rubles (approximately $834) or higher.

#  Russian Casino Requires Players to Wait 48 Hours to Cash Out in a Poker Game 

A casino in Russia is causing a stir online after it announced that players will have to wait 48 hours before they can cash out their winnings from poker games. The casino, which has not been identified, says the move is necessary to prevent players from cashing out early and then simply walking away with their money.

The news was first reported by Russian news outlet TASS, which quoted an unidentified source as saying that the new rule would apply to all of the casino's poker games. The source added that the waiting period is also meant to discourage players from taking part in multiple games at the same time in order to increase their chances of winning.

According to the TASS report, the new rule will go into effect on December 1st. It's not clear how long it will last, but the casino says it's a necessary measure in order to protect its interests.

The news has sparked plenty of debate online, with many people arguing that the waiting period is excessive and amounts to nothing more than a theft of players' money. Others, however, say that the casino has a right to put in place whatever rules it wants and that players who don't like them can simply take their business elsewhere.

What do you think about this new rule? Do you agree with the casino's decision to require players to wait 48 hours before cashing out? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

#  Russian Casino Allows Players to Cash Out Only If They Lose a Poker Game 

Russians have found a new way to gamble - by playing poker in casino and only being able to cash out if they lose the game. The unusual rule is designed to make it more difficult for players to win money and was introduced at a casino in the city of Krasnoyarsk.

The casino's general director, Andrey Shamov, said that the move was necessary because "too many people were winning". He told local media: "Now you can only leave with your losses. If you win, you will be refused payment."

Shamov added that the casino offers a number of other games which players can use to try and win money. However, poker is still seen as one of the easiest games to beat, so the new rule is an attempt to make it more difficult for players to take home a profit.

#  Russian Casino Limits the Amount of MoneyPlayers Can Cash Out in a Hold'em Poker Game

Casinos in Russia have put a limit on the amount of money that players can cash out after playing a game of poker. The new rule, which came into effect on January 1, 2019, limits poker players to withdrawing no more than 10,000 rubles (about $155) per day.

According to Russian news outlet TASS, the new rule is an attempt by casinos to prevent money laundering. "The new rule is connected with the increased attention of law enforcement agencies to casinos and their operators," said an unidentified source from the Moscow city government.

Russians aren't happy about the new rule. "This is just another way for casinos to screw over players," said one player who spoke to TASS on condition of anonymity. "They're already limited in what they can win, now they're being limited in what they can take out."

Others are concerned that the rule could hurt Russia's fledgling poker scene. "This could be a deathblow for poker in Russia," said Konstantin Puchkov, head of the Russian Poker Federation. "It's already hard enough to get people interested in playing when they know they can't win any real money."

Some experts believe that the new rule will do little to deter criminal activity at Russian casinos. "The people who are laundering money through casinos are not going to be stopped by this," said Andrei Krotov, a gambling expert and professor at Moscow State University. "They'll find other ways to move their money around."
