#  Real Madrid reclaims La Liga crown with win over Valencia 

In a dominant 3-1 victory over Valencia, Real Madrid reclaimed the La Liga crown for the 33rd time. Los Blancos captain Sergio Ramos led by example, scoring a brace while also providing an assist for Mariano Diaz’s opening goal.

The title race had been neck and neck going into the final day of the season, with both Madrid and Barcelona having 85 points. However, while Barca stumbled to a goalless draw against Eibar, Zinedine Zidane’s side made sure there was no fairy-tale ending for Lionel Messi & Co. as they cruised to three points at the Mestalla.

With Cristiano Ronaldo now plying his trade in Turin with Juventus, it is fair to say that this success has been built on collective team effort, with players such as Karim Benzema (22 goals in all competitions), Isco (15 goals) and Gareth Bale (10 goals) all chipping in when needed.

There is no doubt that they will be a force to be reckoned with once again next season and will be looking to add Champions League glory to their La Liga trophy.

#  Barcelona's unbeaten season comes to an end with shocking loss to Leganes 

A 2-1 defeat to Leganes brought Barcelona's unbeaten season in all competitions to an end. The Liga champions had not tasted defeat since a 4-3 loss to Roma in the Champions League on April 24.

Leganes started well and took the lead in the ninth minute when Nordin Amrabat headed in Diego Rico's free-kick. Barcelona equalised shortly before half-time through Luis Suarez, but Amrabat netted again midway through the second half to hand the home side victory.

The result means that Barcelona finish the Liga season one point behind champions Real Madrid, while Leganes are 15th in the table with 42 points.

#  Atletico Madrid surges to 2nd place with victory over Sevilla 

Atletico Madrid recorded a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Sevilla on Saturday night, with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa.

The result sees Atletico leapfrog their opponents and move up to second place in La Liga, just two points behind Barcelona.

Sevilla threatened first when Vitolo whipped in a dangerous cross from the right flank, but neither Luis Muriel nor Joaquin Correa could make a proper connection.

Atletico then took the lead in the 25th minute when Griezmann met a corner from Costa with a powerful header that flew into the top corner.

Costa himself then doubled the advantage eight minutes later, firing home after being played through by Koke.

 Sevilla pulled one back late on through substitute Wissam Ben Yedder, but it was too little too late for the Andalusians.

#  Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao battle to a 1-1 draw 

Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad battled to a 1-1 draw on Sunday night at the San Mamés Stadium.

The home side had the first chance of the match in the sixth minute when Aritz Aduriz’s header was tipped over the bar by goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli. However, it was Real Sociedad who opened the scoring in the 24th minute when Carlos Vela’s free-kick found its way through a sea of players and into the back of the net. Athletic Bilbao were level just before halftime when Iñaki Williams headed home Markel Susaeta’s cross.

Both sides had chances to win it in the second half, but neither could find a decisive goal as the spoils were shared.

Athletic Bilbao remain in 10th place in La Liga with 23 points, while Real Sociedad are in 12th place with 21 points.

#  Levante remains in the relegation zone after losing to Espanyol

Levante's dismal season continued on Wednesday night as they lost 2-0 away to Espanyol.

The home side took the lead in the first half through a goal from Sergio Garcia, before Pau Lopez made sure of the three points with a second-half strike.

With the defeat, Levante remain in the relegation zone, five points adrift of safety with just six games remaining.

Next up for Paco Lopez's side is a trip to Girona, before they host Real Madrid in their final home game of the season.
