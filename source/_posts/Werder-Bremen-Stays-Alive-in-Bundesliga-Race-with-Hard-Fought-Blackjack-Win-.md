#  Werder Bremen Stays Alive in Bundesliga Race with Hard-Fought Blackjack Win 

Bremen entered Saturday's matchup as massive underdogs, but they put in a gutsy performance that has them right back in the thick of the Bundesliga title race.

The home side found themselves down 2-0 after just 15 minutes, but they battled back to earn a hard-fought 3-2 victory.

This was a huge win for Bremen, who are now just four points behind league leaders Bayern Munich with four games remaining.

"We never stopped believing," said Bremen midfielder Davy Klaassen. "We knew we could get back into this game, and we're really happy with the three points."

Bremen were missing several key players due to injury, but that didn't stop them from picking up an important win.

"Everyone stepped up when needed," said Klaassen. "It was a great team effort."

Bremen will need to continue playing with this kind of intensity if they want to catch Bayern and earn their first Bundesliga title in 19 years.

Eintracht Frankfurt looked to have earned a point on the road against SV Werder Bremen, but late goal from Max Kruse lifted the home side to a 1-0 victory.

The match started off cagey, with both sides feeling each other out and looking for an opportunity to create a chance. Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky was called into action in the 18th minute when he made a save off of a free kick from Johannes Eggestein.

Frankfurt had their best chance of the first half in the 39th minute when Sebastien Haller hit the post after being played in by Luka Jovic. Werder were able to make it to halftime with the score still tied at 0-0.

Werder came out firing in the second half and were rewarded in the 61st minute when Max Kruse scored his 8th goal of the season. The goal was set up by Milot Rashica who dribbled around two defenders before playing in Kruse for the finish.

Frankfurt pushed for an equalizer but were unable to break down the Werder defense. They came close late in injury time when substitute Mijat Gacinovic’s shot hit the crossbar, but ultimately couldn’t find an equalizer.

The win lifts Werder up to 7th place in the Bundesliga, while Frankfurt stay in 12th place.

The second half was just as frenetic as the first, with both teams having chances to take the lead.
