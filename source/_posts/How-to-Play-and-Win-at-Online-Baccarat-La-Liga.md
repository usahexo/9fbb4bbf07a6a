#  How to Play and Win at Online Baccarat La Liga

Online Baccarat La Liga is a very popular casino game all over the world. It is also known as Punto Banco. This game is easy to play and has a low house edge.

In order to play the game, you will need to place a bet on the player, banker, or tie. The dealer then deals two cards to the player and two cards to the banker. The goal of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible. The highest hand is a nine and the lowest hand is a two.

If the hand total is over 10, then the first digit is dropped (e.g. 15 becomes 5). Aces are worth 1 or 11, depending on what would make the best hand. For example, if you have an ace and a four, your hand total would be 5 because having an ace and four totals five points.

If either of the player’s cards totals 8 or 9, then that player automatically wins. If both cards are equal (e.g. 2 + 2), it is called a “tie” and no one wins or loses money on that particular round.

The banker always draws another card if their total is between 0 and 4 inclusive, while the player always stands on totals of 6 or more (except in case of doubling). After all players have had their turn,the banker stops drawing cards at 7 or more inclusive). In Online Baccarat La Liga there are six decks used per shoe with 104 cards each; 48 are high cards (kings, queens and jacks) and 56 are low cards (2 through 10).

  So how do you make money playing?

  You can make money playing by using basic strategy which tells you when to hit or stand for each possible combination of your first two cards and Banker's up-card: 
If you're starting with two naturals (an eight or nine), you always win automatically—no matter what the banker's up-card is. If your starting hands are anything else besides 8 or 9, use this chart:

  * `Stand` if dealer's card is:<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A<br> * `Hit` if dealer's card is:<br>4 3 2 A 6 5 4 3 2 1

2) Keep track of your bankroll – It is important not to over-extend yourself when playing baccarat; always leave yourself enough money to cover at least twenty bets. This will help you avoid going bust should you lose several hands in a row.
