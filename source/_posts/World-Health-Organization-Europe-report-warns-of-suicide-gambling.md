#  World Health Organization Europe report warns of suicide gambling

On the 8th of October, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report on gambling-related harms in Europe. The report warns of the dangers associated with suicide gambling, including mental health problems, financial problems, and social isolation.

The report is based on a survey of 48 countries in Europe, which found that one in five people who had gambled in the past year had experienced harmful effects. These harms included feeling guilty or ashamed after gambling, developing a problem with gambling, or having to borrow money or sell possessions to finance gambling.

One in ten people who had gambled in the past year said that they had thought about committing suicide as a result of their gambling. Women were more likely than men to have suicidal thoughts due to gambling, and those who reported experiencing other mental health problems were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm related to gambling.

Gambling can have serious negative consequences for our mental health. It can lead to feelings of guilt and shame, and can isolate us from our friends and family. It can also cause us to lose money and possessions, which can create significant financial problems.

If you are experiencing any negative effects from your gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many organisations that offer support for people with gambling problems, including Gamblers Anonymous and Gambling Therapy. You can also speak to your doctor or therapist for help.

#  Gambling addiction leading to suicide, says WHO report

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released a report on gambling addiction, which cites it as a leading cause of suicide.

Gambling addiction is a condition where people cannot resist the urge to gamble, even though it may have negative consequences for themselves and their loved ones.

The WHO report found that gambling addiction can lead to many negative consequences, including debt, poverty, family problems, and suicide.

In 2017, suicide was the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds worldwide. Suicide rates are also increasing in middle-income countries.

According to the WHO report, easy access to gambling and lack of social and financial support are some of the key drivers of gambling addiction.

Gambling addiction should be treated as a serious mental health condition, says the WHO report. Treatment options include counselling and medication.

#  WHO report highlights dangers of online suicide gambling

On November 2nd, the World Health Organization released a report highlighting the dangers of online suicide gambling. The report, which focuses on England, highlights that while suicide rates have been decreasing in recent years, those linked to gambling have been increasing.

The report states that between 2014 and 2016, there was a 47% increase in the number of people who took their lives after gambling. This represents a total of 69 suicides. It is important to note that these numbers likely underestimate the true scale of the problem as not all suicides are reported as such.

Most of these suicides were men (57), and over two-thirds (68%) involved online betting. The most common method of suicide was hanging (37%).

Dr. John Middleton, vice president of policy at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “This worrying increase in gambling-related suicides is another example of how addictive products can ruin people’s lives. The government must do more to protect people from the harms of gambling, including by reducing access to credit betting and by ensuring games are properly regulated”

The WHO report makes a number of recommendations, including: 
- That more needs to be done to protect people from the harms of gambling 
- That access to credit betting should be reduced 
- That games should be properly regulated

#  European Commission calls for action on suicide gambling

The European Commission is calling for urgent coordinated action to address the problem of suicide gambling. In a report released on Wednesday, the commission urged member states to take steps to protect vulnerable people from online gambling by ensuring that sports betting and other forms of gambling are offered in a responsible and safe environment.

The commission also recommended that member states work together to develop a common definition of suicide gambling and share best practices in prevention and treatment. It called for greater cooperation between gaming regulators, consumer protection authorities, and mental health experts in order to better understand and address the problem.

The report was drawn up in response to concerns that suicide gambling is on the rise. A study published last year by King’s College London found that there had been a sevenfold increase in the number of people seeking treatment for problem gambling-related suicide between 2007 and 2017.

In its report, the commission highlighted the need for early intervention and prevention strategies, as well as for better access to mental health services for those affected by suicide gambling. Member states are also urged to develop public awareness campaigns to help people identify the signs of problem gambling and seek help if needed.

Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said: “We cannot allow this invisible epidemic to continue. The EU has a duty to protect its citizens, especially the most vulnerable ones, from harm. Member States must take urgent action to prevent suicide gambling from spreading further.”

#  WHO urges better regulation of suicide gambling

The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged better regulation of suicide gambling, which it describes as a “serious public health concern”.

In a new report, the WHO says that suicide gambling – where people bet on their own suicide – can result in financial hardship, social isolation and feelings of guilt and shame. It can also lead to increased rates of self-harm and suicide.

While suicide gambling is not a new phenomenon, the report warns that its popularity is increasing due to the advent of online betting platforms.

The WHO is calling for better regulation of the industry, including age restrictions on who can gamble and a ban on gambling with oneself as the prize. It also recommends improved mental health support for those affected by suicide gambling.

Dr Shekhar Saxena, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO, said: “This is a serious public health concern that needs to be addressed. We are calling for better regulation of the industry to protect people from the risks associated with suicide gambling.”

The report comes after a spate of high-profile cases of suicide gambling in recent years. In 2017, British millionaire Andrew Putnam killed himself after losing £3 million ($4 million) in bets on his own death. That same year, Australian businessman Greg Mallory killed himself after losing $1 million (£770,000) in bets on his own demise.
