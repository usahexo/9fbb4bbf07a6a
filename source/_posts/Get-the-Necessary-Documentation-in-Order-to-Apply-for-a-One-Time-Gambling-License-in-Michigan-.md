The first step is contacting the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB). The MGCB can provide potential licensees with a wealth of information, including the eligibility requirements, application process, and required fees. They can be reached at 517-334-8566 or mgcb@michigan.gov.

If you are wondering whether or not gambling is legal in Michigan, it is important to note that the state’s laws are somewhat ambiguous on this issue. Gambling is technically only legal if it is conducted in accordance with state law. However, there are no specific laws prohibiting most forms of gambling (except for poker), so it is up to law enforcement officials to enforce these laws as they see fit. This has resulted in a great deal of uncertainty among casino owners and players alike.

It should also be mentioned that there have been recent efforts by some lawmakers to legalize online gambling in Michigan. If this were to happen, it would likely supersede any existing licensing requirements currently in place.
