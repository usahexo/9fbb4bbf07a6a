<p>Officials in Havana say the new blackjack tables will help improve Cuba’s tourism infrastructure and give visitors more options when it comes to gambling. The move is also seen as a way of bringing in much-needed hard currency to help prop up the country’s ailing economy.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about this new development,” said Eduardo Hernandez, director of Cuba’s state gaming authority. “The new blackjack tables will offer a unique experience for tourists, and provide a much-needed boost to our economy.”</p>
<p>While there is no set date for the launch of the new blackjack tables, officials say they should be operational within the next few months.</p>
<h1 id="Cuba-Welcomes-Foreigners-to-Play-Hard-or-Soft-Currency-Blackjack"><a href="#Cuba-Welcomes-Foreigners-to-Play-Hard-or-Soft-Currency-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Cuba Welcomes Foreigners to Play Hard or Soft Currency Blackjack"></a>Cuba Welcomes Foreigners to Play Hard or Soft Currency Blackjack</h1><p>Cuba is a country where you can still find plenty of untouched beauty. The locals are warm and welcoming, and the beaches are to die for. Cuba is also a place where you can visit the casino and play some blackjack - but there are a few things you should know before you go.</p>
<p>First, Cuban casinos only allow foreigners to gamble in hard currency (dollars or euros). So if you want to try your hand at blackjack, be prepared to bring some foreign currency with you. Second, the minimum bet at a Cuban casino is usually around $5 or €5, so it’s not a place for penny-pinchers.</p>
<p>Finally, although the games themselves are pretty relaxed, Cuban casinos tend to be very smoke-filled. If you’re not used to smoking in confined spaces, it might be best to avoid the casino altogether.</p>
<p>Despite these few drawbacks, most visitors find that Cuba’s casinos are a fun way to spend an evening - and they’re definitely one of the best places to gamble in all of Latin America.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Cuba-Ready-for-the-Ad-onslaught-of-Soft-and-Hard-Currency-Blackjack"><a href="#Is-Cuba-Ready-for-the-Ad-onslaught-of-Soft-and-Hard-Currency-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Is Cuba Ready for the Ad onslaught of Soft and Hard Currency Blackjack?"></a>Is Cuba Ready for the Ad onslaught of Soft and Hard Currency Blackjack?</h1><p>The soft and hard currency blackjack game might be the next big thing to hit Cuba. As the country becomes more open to the world, it is allowing increased access to American-style casino games. This could be a boon for the country’s economy, as well as its tourism industry.</p>
<p>There are already some casinos open in Cuba, but they are limited in what they can offer. The new games, which include blackjack, roulette and craps, will be available in a wider range of venues. This opens up opportunities for both tourists and locals to participate in casino gaming.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the Cuban government is trying to increase exposure to these games in order to prepare the population for full-scale casino gambling. It is possible that this could eventually happen, but there are some hurdles that need to be overcome first.</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles is that there is no legal framework for casino gambling in Cuba. This means that any decisions about whether or not to implement such a system would have to be made by the government. There is also the question of how such a system would be regulated and managed.</p>
<p>Another issue is that there are currently no casinos licensed to operate in Cuba. This means that any companies looking to set up operations on the island would have to go through a lengthy approval process. It’s possible that this could change in the future, but it remains to be seen if there is enough interest from investors.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much discussion about introducing full-scale casino gambling in Cuba. However, with the increasing interest in blackjack and other American-style games, it’s likely only a matter of time before this becomes a more serious topic of debate.</p>
<h1 id="A-Glimpse-into-How-Cuba-Deals-Soft-and-Hard-with-Blackjack"><a href="#A-Glimpse-into-How-Cuba-Deals-Soft-and-Hard-with-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="A Glimpse into How Cuba Deals (Soft and Hard) with Blackjack"></a>A Glimpse into How Cuba Deals (Soft and Hard) with Blackjack</h1><p>Players looking for blackjack games in Cuba will find a variety of options. Games can be found in casinos, and there are also opportunities to play blackjack in Havana’s nightclubs. The casino games are played with six decks of cards, which are shuffled after each hand. The following rules apply: </p>
<p>The dealer stands on all 17s.</p>
<p>Doubling down is allowed on any two cards.</p>
<p>Split aces receive only one card.</p>
<p>Re-splitting of aces is not allowed.</p>
<p>Drawing to split aces is not allowed.</p>
<p>#Blackjack in Cuba Clubs vs Casinos<br>Club 21 is Havana’s most popular nightspot and it offers an excellent opportunity to experience blackjack in Cuba. This nightclub operates like a casino, with the exception that players are able to walk up and play without having to make a purchase inside the club. A $5 cover charge gives access to all the games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. Drinks and food can be purchased from the club’s bar and restaurant. The nightspot is open until 4am, which makes it an ideal place to continue the party after leaving the casino.<br>Casino Habana is Havana’s largest casino and it is where most visitors go to play blackjack in Cuba. This gambling hall features more than 60 tables, including blackjack, craps, roulette, baccarat, and poker games. The minimum bet for blackjack is $5 and the maximum bet is $500. One unique feature at Casino Habana is that players are able to bet on both hands when splitting pairs. The casino also offers a Players Club card which rewards members with free drinks, snacks, and discounts on rooms at the property’s hotel.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Tourists-flock-to-Cuba-to-Play-Soft-and-Hard-Currency-Blackjack"><a href="#Will-Tourists-flock-to-Cuba-to-Play-Soft-and-Hard-Currency-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Will Tourists flock to Cuba to Play Soft and Hard Currency Blackjack?"></a>Will Tourists flock to Cuba to Play Soft and Hard Currency Blackjack?</h1><p>A recent article in the New York Times [1] reports that the US Treasury Department has issued new regulations that will allow American tourists to visit Cuba and play blackjack at the country’s casinos. The article raises the question of whether this development will result in a flood of American tourists travelling to Cuba to play blackjack and spend their hard currency.</p>
<p>The answer to that question is likely “no”. Although there may be a small uptick in American tourism to Cuba, the bulk of tourism to that country is still likely to come from other countries, such as Canada and Europe. That’s because, despite the new regulations, there are still many restrictions on travel to Cuba for Americans. For example, Americans cannot visit Cuba for tourist purposes without a special license from the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the casinos in Cuba don’t offer particularly good odds for blackjack players. The house edge at most Cuban casinos is around 3%, which is much higher than what players can find at most casinos in Las Vegas or elsewhere in the US. So even if more Americans do start travelling to Cuba to play blackjack, they are likely to be disappointed with their results at the casino tables.</p>
<p>That said, there’s no doubt that some Americans will travel to Cuba specifically to play blackjack and gamble with their hard currency. And if they do, they’re likely to find a warm welcome from Cuban casino operators, who are looking for ways to attract more tourists to their casinos.</p>
