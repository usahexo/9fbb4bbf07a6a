<p>The home side found themselves down 2-0 after just 15 minutes, but they battled back to earn a hard-fought 3-2 victory.</p>
<p>This was a huge win for Bremen, who are now just four points behind league leaders Bayern Munich with four games remaining.</p>
<p>“We never stopped believing,” said Bremen midfielder Davy Klaassen. “We knew we could get back into this game, and we’re really happy with the three points.”</p>
<p>Bremen were missing several key players due to injury, but that didn’t stop them from picking up an important win.</p>
<p>“Everyone stepped up when needed,” said Klaassen. “It was a great team effort.”</p>
<p>Bremen will need to continue playing with this kind of intensity if they want to catch Bayern and earn their first Bundesliga title in 19 years.</p>
<h1 id="Werder-Bremen-Gets-Big-Blackjack-Victory-Over-Mainz-05"><a href="#Werder-Bremen-Gets-Big-Blackjack-Victory-Over-Mainz-05" class="headerlink" title="Werder Bremen Gets Big Blackjack Victory Over Mainz 05"></a>Werder Bremen Gets Big Blackjack Victory Over Mainz 05</h1><p>In what was a dramatic and action-packed game, Werder Bremen managed to take all three points in a 5-2 victory over Mainz 05. The Black &amp; Whites took control of the game early on, and never let go.</p>
<p>Zlatko Junuzović opened the scoring for Bremen in the 15th minute with a fine finish from the edge of the box. The midfielder has now scored in four consecutive games for his club. Maximilian Eggestein then made it 2-0 just before halftime with a composed header from close range.</p>
<p>Mainz 05 pulled one back through Danny Latza in the 54th minute, but any hopes of a comeback were quickly quashed as Claudio Pizarro made it 3-1 just two minutes later. The Peruvian striker has now scored in each of his last four appearances against Mainz 05. Yuya Osako then added insult to injury with two goals in the last ten minutes to seal an emphatic win for Werder Bremen.</p>
<p>The result sees Florian Kohfeldt’s side move up to sixth place in the Bundesliga table, just one point behind fifth placed Bayer Leverkusen. They will be looking to continue their good form when they take on RB Leipzig next weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Late-Goal-Lifts-SV-Werder-Bremen-Over-Eintracht-Frankfurt-in-Blackjack-Match"><a href="#Late-Goal-Lifts-SV-Werder-Bremen-Over-Eintracht-Frankfurt-in-Blackjack-Match" class="headerlink" title="Late Goal Lifts SV Werder Bremen Over Eintracht Frankfurt in Blackjack Match"></a>Late Goal Lifts SV Werder Bremen Over Eintracht Frankfurt in Blackjack Match</h1><p>Eintracht Frankfurt looked to have earned a point on the road against SV Werder Bremen, but late goal from Max Kruse lifted the home side to a 1-0 victory.</p>
<p>The match started off cagey, with both sides feeling each other out and looking for an opportunity to create a chance. Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky was called into action in the 18th minute when he made a save off of a free kick from Johannes Eggestein.</p>
<p>Frankfurt had their best chance of the first half in the 39th minute when Sebastien Haller hit the post after being played in by Luka Jovic. Werder were able to make it to halftime with the score still tied at 0-0.</p>
<p>Werder came out firing in the second half and were rewarded in the 61st minute when Max Kruse scored his 8th goal of the season. The goal was set up by Milot Rashica who dribbled around two defenders before playing in Kruse for the finish.</p>
<p>Frankfurt pushed for an equalizer but were unable to break down the Werder defense. They came close late in injury time when substitute Mijat Gacinovic’s shot hit the crossbar, but ultimately couldn’t find an equalizer.</p>
<p>The win lifts Werder up to 7th place in the Bundesliga, while Frankfurt stay in 12th place.</p>
<h1 id="SV-Werder-Bremen-Edges-Bayer-Leverkusen-in-Blackjack-Thriller"><a href="#SV-Werder-Bremen-Edges-Bayer-Leverkusen-in-Blackjack-Thriller" class="headerlink" title="SV Werder Bremen Edges Bayer Leverkusen in Blackjack Thriller"></a>SV Werder Bremen Edges Bayer Leverkusen in Blackjack Thriller</h1><p>Coming into this weekend’s Bundesliga action, many were looking forward to the clash of two top six sides in Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen. The match did not disappoint, with both teams playing very well and the spectators treated to an exciting blackjack match.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Werder that emerged victorious, edging their opponents 3-2. The result keeps Werder in excellent form and up in the table, while Bayer Leverkusen have some work to do to get back into the Champions League places.</p>
<p>The match began at a frantic pace, with both teams pressing high and looking for an opening goal. It was Bayer that drew first blood though, as Kai Havertz smashed a shot past the goalkeeper following good work from Kevin Volland on the left wing.</p>
<p>Werder were not behind for long, and soon equalized through Milot Rashica. The goal came about following a good team move which saw Ludovic Sané lay the ball off to Max Kruse; his effort was saved but Rashica was on hand to tap home the rebound.</p>
<p>After that it was all Bayer, with Havertz going close on a number of occasions. However, Werder held firm and went into halftime level pegging.</p>
<p>The second half was just as frenetic as the first, with both teams having chances to take the lead. In the end it was Werder who scored what turned out to be the winning goal; after some good work by Rashica down the right flank, he crossed for Zlatko Junuzović who finished clinically from close range.</p>
<p>Bayer refused to give up and pulled one back through Dominik Kohr late on, but it was too little too late as Werder held on for a hard-fought victory.</p>
<h1 id="Dramatic-Comeback-Earns-SV-Werder-Bremen-Victory-Over-Hoffenheim-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Dramatic-Comeback-Earns-SV-Werder-Bremen-Victory-Over-Hoffenheim-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Dramatic Comeback Earns SV Werder Bremen Victory Over Hoffenheim in Blackjack"></a>Dramatic Comeback Earns SV Werder Bremen Victory Over Hoffenheim in Blackjack</h1><p>In a thrilling game at the Weserstadion, SV Werder Bremen erased a three-goal deficit to earn a 4-3 victory over TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in blackjack.</p>
<p>It was a tale of two halves for Werder, who got off to a terrible start, allowing Hoffenheim to take a 3-0 lead into halftime. But Werder came out firing in the second half,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> led by forward Max Kruse, who scored two goals to bring his team within one.</p>
<p>The comeback was complete in the 73rd minute when midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic netted the equalizer. That set the stage for a dramatic finish, as both teams went back and forth until scoring their fourth goal. In the end it was Werder who prevailed, with defender Lamine Sané popping up with the winner in the 89th minute.</p>
<p>The victory lifts Werder to ninth place in the Bundesliga table, just four points off of fifth-place Hoffenheim. It was also an important win for head coach Alexander Nouri, who had come under criticism in recent weeks after a run of poor results.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly important win for us and for our coach,” said Sané after the match. “We were down 3-0 at halftime but we never gave up. We fought until the end and we were rewarded with this amazing victory.”</p>
