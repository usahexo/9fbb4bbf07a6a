        <h1 id="NBA-Commissioner-Adam-Silver-Calls-For-legalization-of-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#NBA-Commissioner-Adam-Silver-Calls-For-legalization-of-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Calls For legalization of Sports Gambling"></a>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Calls For legalization of Sports Gambling</h1><p>In a recent interview with ESPN, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made it clear that he believes sports gambling should be legalized across the United States.</p>
<p>This is a hugely significant move, as it could potentially lead to a massive surge in revenue for the NBA – and other professional sports leagues – as well as more widespread interest in the sport of basketball.</p>
<p>Commissioner Silver also made it clear that he feels that the current system, which sees sports gambling taking place illegally and unregulated throughout much of the country, is not working. He believes that legalizing and regulating the activity would be better for everyone involved.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no response from the NFL or any other professional sports league, but it seems likely that at least some of them will follow Silver’s lead on this issue in the near future.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that this move by Silver is not just about making money for the NBA. He also believes that legalizing sports gambling would be good for society as a whole, as it would help to protect consumers and ensure that everything is done fairly.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk about legalizing sports gambling in recent years, but up until now no one in a position of power has taken such a strong stance on the issue. It will be interesting to see how things develop from here.</p>
<h1 id="Silver-Sports-Gambling-a-Key-Component-to-the-Future-of-the-NBA"><a href="#Silver-Sports-Gambling-a-Key-Component-to-the-Future-of-the-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Silver: Sports Gambling a Key Component to the Future of the NBA"></a>Silver: Sports Gambling a Key Component to the Future of the NBA</h1><p>In a recent interview with silver, he discusses the future of the NBA and how sports gambling will play a role. Sports gambling has been illegal in almost every state for many years, but that is starting to change. In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal ban on sports betting was unconstitutional. This has led to many states, including New Jersey, to begin legalizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>This is a huge opportunity for the NBA. The NFL and MLB have been able to capitalize on sports gambling in the past, and the NBA needs to do the same. Silver recognizes this and is working to make sure that the NBA is ready for this change. He has been meeting with casino executives and trying to come up with a plan for how the NBA can take advantage of this new opportunity.</p>
<p>Sports gambling is a huge part of our culture, and it is only going to become more popular in the future. The NFL and MLB have been able to capitalize on this by putting casinos at their stadiums. This allows people to bet on games while they are at the game. The NBA needs to do something similar if it wants to take advantage of this new opportunity.</p>
<p>Silver also discussed how blockchain could play a role in the future of the NBA. Blockchain is a technology that allows you to make secure transactions online without having to trust a third party. This could be used to create a system where fans can bet on games without having to worry about fraud or cheating.</p>
<p>The future of the NBA is looking bright. Sports gambling will play a major role in its growth, and blockchain could help make it even more successful.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-Sports-Gambling-Will-Bring-in-Billions-for-Leagues-and-Teams"><a href="#Legal-Sports-Gambling-Will-Bring-in-Billions-for-Leagues-and-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Legal Sports Gambling Will Bring in Billions for Leagues and Teams"></a>Legal Sports Gambling Will Bring in Billions for Leagues and Teams</h1><p>Leagues and teams across the United States are about to rake in billions of dollars from legalized sports gambling, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association released a study Wednesday that said legal sports betting could bring in $4.7 billion for leagues and teams annually. The NFL could bring in the most money with $2.3 billion, while the NBA and MLB would earn $1.1 billion and $690 million, respectively.</p>
<p>“Legalized sports betting is coming to America, and the AGA is ensuring that all stakeholders reap the rewards,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “This report underscores the importance of thoughtful policymaking around this growing industry. We look forward to working with lawmakers and regulators as they craft effective, responsible policies that protect consumers, preserve the integrity of games and generate new revenue for states and municipalities across the country.”</p>
<p>The Briefing | Gambling Industry Poised to Make Billions as Leagues Benefit</p>
<h1 id="If-It’s-Good-Enough-for-Nevada-It’s-Good-Enough-for-the-Rest-of-Us"><a href="#If-It’s-Good-Enough-for-Nevada-It’s-Good-Enough-for-the-Rest-of-Us" class="headerlink" title="If It’s Good Enough for Nevada, It’s Good Enough for the Rest of Us"></a>If It’s Good Enough for Nevada, It’s Good Enough for the Rest of Us</h1><p>Earlier this year, Nevada became the first state in the country to legalize autonomous vehicles. Nevada’s Department of Motor Vehicles issued regulations governing the operation of autonomous vehicles in May, and on October 13, Google’s autonomous car successfully completed its first road test in Nevada.</p>
<p>The Nevada law, which was signed by Governor Brian Sandoval in June, authorizes the operation of autonomous cars on the state’s highways as long as a human is behind the wheel “to take control of the vehicle if necessary.” The law also requires autonomous vehicles to have a dedicated data recorder to capture information about how the car was operated.</p>
<p>Nevada’s action was not unexpected. In February, Google announced that it had been testing autonomous cars on public roads in California for several years. The company said it had “driven hundreds of thousands of miles on public streets and freeways” without incident.</p>
<p>It’s not just Google that’s testing self-driving cars. Nissan has announced plans to begin selling an autonomous car by 2020 and Tesla is already selling an “autopilot” system that allows some degree of self-driving on highways.</p>
<p>Why are companies investing in autonomous cars? There are several reasons. First, autonomous cars could dramatically reduce traffic fatalities. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were over 33,000 traffic fatalities in the United States in 2012. Human error is a major contributor to traffic fatalities and theoretically, self-driving cars would eliminate that factor.</p>
<p>Second, autonomous cars could reduce traffic congestion. Studies have shown that up to 30% of urban traffic congestion is caused by drivers looking for parking spaces. If driverless cars can be directed to park themselves away from city centers, that would free up valuable space and reduce pollution levels.</p>
<p>Third, autonomous cars could save businesses money. Autonomous vehicles don’t need to stop for lunch or take bathroom breaks and they can operate 24 hours a day without getting tired or sick. That could result in significant cost savings for businesses that rely on truck drivers or package delivery services.</p>
<p>Finally, many people believe that self-driving cars will ultimately be cheaper than traditional cars. The average cost of ownership for a traditional car is about $8,000 per year while the average cost of ownership for an electric car is about $5,000 per year (assuming 8 cents per kWh). If self-driving technology can bring those costs down even further, it could revolutionize transportation.</p>

In a statement, Silver said that he is in favor of legalizing sports betting with the “appropriate regulatory framework” in order to protect the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently illegal in most states, but there is an active black market for sports wagers. States that do allow limited sports betting typically have very strict regulations, which can make it difficult for consumers to place a wager.</p>
<p>Commissioner Silver’s endorsement could pave the way for a more regulated and safe sports betting market. It’s unclear whether Congress will take action on this issue, but there is growing bipartisan support for legalizing sports betting.</p>
