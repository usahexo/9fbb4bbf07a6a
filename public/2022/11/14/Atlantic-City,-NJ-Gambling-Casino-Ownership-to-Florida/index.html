        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-NJ-Gambling-Casino-Ownership-to-Florida"><a href="#Atlantic-City-NJ-Gambling-Casino-Ownership-to-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City, NJ Gambling Casino Ownership to Florida?"></a>Atlantic City, NJ Gambling Casino Ownership to Florida?</h1><p>Las Vegas Sands, the casino company owned by Sheldon Adelson, has plans to sell its ownership stake in the Atlantic City casino industry. This move would see the company divest its ownership of the Marina Casino and Resort, as well as Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced on Monday that the Las Vegas Sands was preparing to sell its interests in both Atlantic City and Bethlehem, PA. The move would see the company divest all of its ownership in the two casinos, but it is still unclear who the buyers may be.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no comment from Las Vegas Sands or Adelson himself about these reports. This isn’t the first time that Adelson has shown interest in selling his interests in Atlantic City. Last year, he was looking for a buyer for the Marina Casino and Resort, but no deal was ever reached.</p>
<p>Atlantic City Gambling Casino Ownership to Florida?</p>
<p>If this sale does go through, it could mean big changes for both the Atlantic City and Bethlehem casino industries. It’s not clear yet what the new owners would do with the properties, but it’s possible that we could see a shift in focus from gambling to other forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s been speculated that one potential buyer for these casinos is Jeffery Augustine Harrah, the owner of Harrah’s Philadelphia Casino. Harrah’s Philadelphia is a much smaller casino than either Marina or Sands Bethlehem, so it’s possible that he could look to expand into those markets.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that we could see these casinos turned into something like resorts. With gambling becoming less and less popular, casinos are looking for ways to bring in more guests. By offering other forms of entertainment - like swimming pools and restaurants - they can create an experience that people will want to come back to time and time again.</p>
<p>Whatever ends up happening with these casinos, one thing is for sure: things are changing in the world of gambling. With more states legalizing online gambling and fewer people visiting land-based casinos, companies are having to find new ways to stay competitive.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Florida’s-Gambling-Boom-Coming-to-an-End"><a href="#Is-Florida’s-Gambling-Boom-Coming-to-an-End" class="headerlink" title="Is Florida’s Gambling Boom Coming to an End?"></a>Is Florida’s Gambling Boom Coming to an End?</h1><p>Florida’s gambling industry has been booming in recent years. Gross gaming revenue (GGR) from casinos and poker rooms in the state totaled $2.5 billion in 2017, a nearly 20% increase from 2016.1 However, this growth may be coming to an end as casino operators face increasing competition from new gaming venues in other states and weak consumer spending.</p>
<p>The state’s largest casino operator, Seminole Gaming, reported a 2% decline in GGR for the fourth quarter of 2018, and its chairman predicted that 2019 would be a “challenging year” for the industry.2 The company’s results were largely due to weak demand from local players, as well as increased competition from new casinos in Mississippi and Pennsylvania.3</p>
<p>In addition, there has been a surge in new gambling venues opening up in other states. In Massachusetts, for example, three new casinos opened in late 2018, and another is scheduled to open in early 2019.4 These casinos are aggressively competing for market share by offering lavish resorts and betting on popular sports teams.5</p>
<p>As a result of this increasing competition, Florida’s casino operators may find it increasingly difficult to grow their businesses. This could have negative consequences for the state’s economy, as gambling is one of its largest sources of tourism revenue.6</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how Florida’s gambling industry will fare in the coming years. However, it appears that the days of robust growth are likely over.</p>
<h1 id="Hollywood-Casino-Gulf-Coast-Sold-to-Out-of-State-Gaming-Company"><a href="#Hollywood-Casino-Gulf-Coast-Sold-to-Out-of-State-Gaming-Company" class="headerlink" title="Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Sold to Out-of-State Gaming Company"></a>Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Sold to Out-of-State Gaming Company</h1><p>The Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast, located in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, was recently sold to an out-of-state gaming company.</p>
<p>The casino is a popular stop along the Gulf Coast for tourists and locals alike, and its new ownership is promising to keep it that way.</p>
<p>In a statement released Wednesday, the new owners said they are committed to “continuing the Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast’s tradition of providing quality entertainment and gaming experience for our guests.”</p>
<p>The sale price was not disclosed, but industry experts say the casino is worth between $150 and $200 million.</p>
<p>The company that purchased the casino is Pinnacle Entertainment, which owns and operates 16 casinos across the United States.</p>
<p>Pinnacle CEO Anthony Sanfilippo said in a statement that his company is “excited to have this opportunity to further grow our regional portfolio with a property as iconic as Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast.”</p>
<p>The casino first opened its doors in 2005 under the name IP Casino Resort Spa. It was later acquired by Penn National Gaming in 2011, and renamed Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast.</p>
<h1 id="Showdown-Brewing-Over-Who-Will-Own-Florida’s-Gambling-Casinos"><a href="#Showdown-Brewing-Over-Who-Will-Own-Florida’s-Gambling-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Showdown Brewing Over Who Will Own Florida’s Gambling Casinos"></a>Showdown Brewing Over Who Will Own Florida’s Gambling Casinos</h1><p>Business owners and casino executives descended upon Tallahassee earlier this month to make their case before the Florida legislature about who should control the state’s gambling industry.</p>
<p>The future of gambling in the Sunshine State has been a contentious issue for years with casinos running in competition with each other and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which argues it has a monopoly on casinos due to a special agreement with the state.</p>
<p>Now, there are proposals to let dog tracks offer slot machines, expand poker rooms at jai-alai frontons, and create new destination resorts with casinos. This would put Florida in line with many other states that have seen increasing revenue from gambling in recent years.</p>
<p>The state’s Senate Gaming Committee heard hours of testimony from business owners, regulators, and tribal leaders as it considers how to rewrite the gambling laws. Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson was on hand to make his case for more tightly regulating online gaming and keeping it out of the state.</p>
<p>Adelson is looking to protect his $25 billion casino empire, which includes the Venetian in Las Vegas and Wynn Resorts. But he faces competition from Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn, who is also pushing for expanded gambling in Florida.</p>
<p>Wynn testified that he is willing to invest $2 billion in a new resort casino project if lawmakers agree to allow slots at pari-mutuel facilities and approve Destination Resort Casinos (DRCs). These would be large complexes with hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, and - of course - casinos.</p>
<p>DRCs would be allowed only in counties that have voted for them in a referendum. That could put the deal at risk in some areas where there may not be enough support for such a project. Miami-Dade County, for example, has already expressed reservations about a DRC being built there.</p>
<p>Representatives of Disney World and other major tourist destinations also testified against expanding gambling saying it would hurt their business. They worry that people will spend less money on Disney vacations if they can gamble nearby.</p>
<p>Florida’s Gambling Industry Heats Up</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owners-in-Florida-Brace-for-Changes"><a href="#Casino-Owners-in-Florida-Brace-for-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owners in Florida Brace for Changes"></a>Casino Owners in Florida Brace for Changes</h1><p>Casino operators in Florida are preparing for a major change in the state’s gambling laws.</p>
<p>The change, which is expected to be approved by the state legislature this year, will allow slot machines at racetracks and jai alai frontons across the state.</p>
<p>The move is expected to generate an additional $1 billion in annual revenue for the state’s casinos, most of which are located in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.</p>
<p>Casino owners in those counties are already bracing for the influx of new competition, with some preparing to install new slot machines and reduce their prices to stay competitive.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a huge change for the industry,” said one casino executive. “There’s no doubt that we’re going to see more competition, but we’re also going to see more revenue coming into the state.”</p>
