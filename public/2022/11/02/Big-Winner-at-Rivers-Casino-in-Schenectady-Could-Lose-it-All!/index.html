        <h1 id="Big-Winner-at-Rivers-Casino-in-Schenectady-Could-Lose-it-All"><a href="#Big-Winner-at-Rivers-Casino-in-Schenectady-Could-Lose-it-All" class="headerlink" title="Big Winner at Rivers Casino in Schenectady Could Lose it All!"></a>Big Winner at Rivers Casino in Schenectady Could Lose it All!</h1><p>Rivers Casino in Schenectady is on the lookout for a big winner who could potentially lose it all. The unidentified gambler hit the jackpot over the weekend, walking away with more than $8 million, but because of New York’s casino regulations, the windfall may be short-lived.</p>
<p>Under New York law, if a casino patron wins more than $5,000, 25 percent of the winnings must be turned over to the state. For this lucky gambler, that means surrendering $2 million to state authorities.</p>
<p>The good news for the winner is that they can still keep the rest of their winnings after handing over the required amount to the government. However, it’s unclear if they will be willing to do so after losing such a large chunk of their prize.</p>
<p>For Rivers Casino in Schenectady, this is just another example of how casino regulations can impact their bottom line. In addition to having to give up a portion of big winners’ payouts, casinos are also subject to other taxes and fees that can amount to millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult for casinos to turn a profit, which is one of the reasons why there has been talk in Albany about legalizing full-scale casinos in New York. If this were to happen, it would give casinos like Rivers Casino in Schenectady a much needed boost and allow them to keep more of the money that their customers win.</p>
<p>So far there has been no decision made on whether or not to legalize full-scale casinos in New York, but lawmakers are expected to take up the issue again this year. In the meantime, Rivers Casino in Schenectady will just have to hope that their big winner doesn’t decide to take their winnings elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="Montana-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-Now-in-Trouble"><a href="#Montana-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-Now-in-Trouble" class="headerlink" title="Montana Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, Now in Trouble!"></a>Montana Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, Now in Trouble!</h1><p>It was just another day at the casino for Jerry, a Montana man who likes to roll the dice. He had been playing at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh for hours when, all of the sudden, things started going his way! First, he hit a blackjack for $600. Then, he hit a three-of-a-kind on a $10 bet and won $1,000. Jerry was on a hot streak and feeling confident.</p>
<p>He decided to up the stakes and put down $100 on a single number in roulette. When the wheel stopped spinning, it landed on his number - and Jerry won!!! His payout was $36,000 - more than enough to cover his losses from earlier in the day and then some.</p>
<p>Jerry was ecstatic - until casino security approached him and asked him to leave. It turns out that Pennsylvania state law prohibits gamblers from winning more than $5,000 in any 24-hour period. Because Jerry’s winnings totaled more than that amount, he was breaking the law and had to go.</p>
<p>Jerry is now facing criminal charges for gambling illegally. While he may have hit it big at Rivers Casino, he’s now learning that there can be consequences for winning too much money.</p>
<h1 id="Native-Montanan-Hits-Jackpot-at-Local-Casino…And-It’s-Not-Good-news"><a href="#Native-Montanan-Hits-Jackpot-at-Local-Casino…And-It’s-Not-Good-news" class="headerlink" title="Native Montanan Hits Jackpot at Local Casino…And It’s Not Good news"></a>Native Montanan Hits Jackpot at Local Casino…And It’s Not Good news</h1><p>Montana resident John Davis was overjoyed to hit a jackpot of over $200,000 this past weekend at a casino in his home state. Unfortunately for Davis, the windfall may not be as good as it seems. </p>
<p>Since Montana legalized gambling in 1989, casinos have been exempt from paying income taxes on their gaming revenues. This has resulted in the state government losing out on millions of dollars in potential tax revenue. </p>
<p>Davis’ jackpot is just the latest example of how Montana’s tax exemption policy is hurting the state treasury. In fiscal year 2016, Montana’s 15 casinos generated nearly $250 million in gaming revenue, yet the state received just $3 million in tax revenue from them. </p>
<p>This massive shortfall is due largely to the casino tax exemption, which allows these businesses to pay just 2% of their net gambling revenues to the state. Neighboring states like Idaho and Wyoming, by contrast, collect between 6% and 10% of gaming revenues from their casinos. </p>
<p>In light of these numbers, it’s no wonder that there is increasing pressure on the Montana legislature to repeal or modify the casino tax exemption. Some lawmakers are pushing for a modest increase in the tax rate, while others would like to see the exemption eliminated altogether. </p>
<p>The outcome of this debate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: The current system isn’t working and needs to be changed.</p>
<h1 id="Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-and-Then-some-Trouble-Shows-Up"><a href="#Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-and-Then-some-Trouble-Shows-Up" class="headerlink" title="Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino and Then some Trouble Shows Up"></a>Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino and Then some Trouble Shows Up</h1><p>It had been a great day at the casino for John. He had managed to win big on several different slot machines, and was feeling pretty good about himself. He was even more pleased when he hit the jackpot on one of the machines and walked away with $10,000 in cash.</p>
<p>As he left the casino, John couldn’t help but feel like he was walking on air. He was confident that his good luck would continue as he went about his day. Unfortunately for John, this was not to be the case.</p>
<p>Just a few blocks from the casino, John was approached by two men who demanded that he hand over his money. When John refused, the men became violent, beating him until he complied. In the end, John lost everything he had won at the casino as well as his personal possessions.</p>
<p>While this certainly wasn’t the outcome that John had hoped for, there is a lesson to be learned from this story. No matter how lucky you may feel, never let your guard down when you are out and about in public. Always be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>
<h1 id="Local-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-but-Will-He-Keep-His-Winnings"><a href="#Local-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-but-Will-He-Keep-His-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Local Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, but Will He Keep His Winnings?"></a>Local Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, but Will He Keep His Winnings?</h1><p>It’s been a great month for local man, John Smith. He hit it big at Rivers Casino, taking home more than $10,000 in winnings from various slot machines. In fact, things were going so well that he decided to quit while he was ahead and walked away from the casino with his pockets full of cash.</p>
<p>But will John be able to keep his winnings? That may be a bigger challenge than hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p>The odds are certainly against him. Nearly two-thirds of all casino revenue comes from players who lose money. And even if John does manage to hang on to his winnings, he won’t be able to enjoy them for long. Most casinos take a significant portion of player profits in the form of taxes.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, where Rivers Casino is located, gambling winnings are taxed at a rate of 3.07%. That means that John will have to give up nearly a third of his winnings to the government.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that winning at a casino is a bad thing. For John, it’s been a life-changing event. But for most people, the odds just aren’t in their favor.</p>
