The book is a collection of chapters that describe how to prepare for and conduct a funeral. It also includes prayers and spells to be used by the deceased in the afterlife. The Book of Tombs is one of the oldest surviving texts from ancient Egypt, dating back to the Old Kingdom period.</p>
<h1 id="Who-wrote-the-book-of-tombs"><a href="#Who-wrote-the-book-of-tombs" class="headerlink" title="Who wrote the book of tombs?"></a>Who wrote the book of tombs?</h1><p>The Book of Tombs is an ancient Egyptian funerary text written by an unknown author. The text is a series of utterances to be spoken by the deceased over the course of their journey into the afterlife.</p>
<p>The Book of Tombs is one of the oldest and most complete funerary texts in existence, dating back to the early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2040-1650 BC). The text consists of a series of spells that guide the deceased through the different stages of the afterlife.</p>
<p>The Book of Tombs was discovered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, and it is now housed in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-the-book-of-tombs-do"><a href="#What-does-the-book-of-tombs-do" class="headerlink" title="What does the book of tombs do?"></a>What does the book of tombs do?</h1><p>The Book of Tombs is an ancient Egyptian funerary text which was probably composed<br>during the Nineteenth Dynasty (c. 1290 BC – c. 1186 BC). The book likely served as a guide<br>for the deceased to navigate the underworld. It is one of the few sources of information about<br>the underworld that was available to the ancient Egyptians.</p>
<p>The Book of Tombs is divided into two parts: the first half provides instructions for getting<br>through the five gates of the underworld, while the second half lists the rewards that are<br>available to those who make it through successfully. These rewards include eternal life,<br>companionship with Osiris, and even resurrection. The Book of Tombs also includes a number of<br>hymns and prayers which were meant to be recited by the deceased in order to secure these benefits.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-books-are-in-the-series"><a href="#How-many-books-are-in-the-series" class="headerlink" title="How many books are in the series?"></a>How many books are in the series?</h1><p>The Harry Potter series is composed of seven books.</p>
<h1 id="When-is-the-next-book-coming-out"><a href="#When-is-the-next-book-coming-out" class="headerlink" title="When is the next book coming out?"></a>When is the next book coming out?</h1><p>We don’t know!</p>
<p>Seriously, we don’t. We’ve been asking our publisher that same question for years. And we keep getting the same answer: “We don’t know.”</p>
<p>We understand your frustration. We’re frustrated, too. In fact, we’re so frustrated that we’ve started to think about ways to work around the publishing process altogether and just release the book ourselves. But even if we did that, we still wouldn’t know when the book would be ready.</p>
<p>So what’s going on?</p>
<p>The simple answer is: Stuff happens. Sometimes a book is delayed because the author needs more time to write. Sometimes a book is delayed because the publisher needs more time to print and ship it to stores. It’s rare, but sometimes a book is even delayed because of a hurricane or other natural disaster.</p>
<p>Publishers are busy people, and they have a lot of books to deal with at any one time. So sometimes things fall through the cracks. And unfortunately, there’s not a whole lot we can do about it except apologize and hope you’ll stick around until the book finally comes out.</p>
