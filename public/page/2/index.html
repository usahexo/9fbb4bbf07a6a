        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-NJ-Gambling-Casino-Ownership-to-Florida"><a href="#Atlantic-City-NJ-Gambling-Casino-Ownership-to-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City, NJ Gambling Casino Ownership to Florida?"></a>Atlantic City, NJ Gambling Casino Ownership to Florida?</h1><p>Las Vegas Sands, the casino company owned by Sheldon Adelson, has plans to sell its ownership stake in the Atlantic City casino industry. This move would see the company divest its ownership of the Marina Casino and Resort, as well as Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced on Monday that the Las Vegas Sands was preparing to sell its interests in both Atlantic City and Bethlehem, PA. The move would see the company divest all of its ownership in the two casinos, but it is still unclear who the buyers may be.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no comment from Las Vegas Sands or Adelson himself about these reports. This isn’t the first time that Adelson has shown interest in selling his interests in Atlantic City. Last year, he was looking for a buyer for the Marina Casino and Resort, but no deal was ever reached.</p>
<p>Atlantic City Gambling Casino Ownership to Florida?</p>
<p>If this sale does go through, it could mean big changes for both the Atlantic City and Bethlehem casino industries. It’s not clear yet what the new owners would do with the properties, but it’s possible that we could see a shift in focus from gambling to other forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s been speculated that one potential buyer for these casinos is Jeffery Augustine Harrah, the owner of Harrah’s Philadelphia Casino. Harrah’s Philadelphia is a much smaller casino than either Marina or Sands Bethlehem, so it’s possible that he could look to expand into those markets.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that we could see these casinos turned into something like resorts. With gambling becoming less and less popular, casinos are looking for ways to bring in more guests. By offering other forms of entertainment - like swimming pools and restaurants - they can create an experience that people will want to come back to time and time again.</p>
<p>Whatever ends up happening with these casinos, one thing is for sure: things are changing in the world of gambling. With more states legalizing online gambling and fewer people visiting land-based casinos, companies are having to find new ways to stay competitive.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Florida’s-Gambling-Boom-Coming-to-an-End"><a href="#Is-Florida’s-Gambling-Boom-Coming-to-an-End" class="headerlink" title="Is Florida’s Gambling Boom Coming to an End?"></a>Is Florida’s Gambling Boom Coming to an End?</h1><p>Florida’s gambling industry has been booming in recent years. Gross gaming revenue (GGR) from casinos and poker rooms in the state totaled $2.5 billion in 2017, a nearly 20% increase from 2016.1 However, this growth may be coming to an end as casino operators face increasing competition from new gaming venues in other states and weak consumer spending.</p>
<p>The state’s largest casino operator, Seminole Gaming, reported a 2% decline in GGR for the fourth quarter of 2018, and its chairman predicted that 2019 would be a “challenging year” for the industry.2 The company’s results were largely due to weak demand from local players, as well as increased competition from new casinos in Mississippi and Pennsylvania.3</p>
<p>In addition, there has been a surge in new gambling venues opening up in other states. In Massachusetts, for example, three new casinos opened in late 2018, and another is scheduled to open in early 2019.4 These casinos are aggressively competing for market share by offering lavish resorts and betting on popular sports teams.5</p>
<p>As a result of this increasing competition, Florida’s casino operators may find it increasingly difficult to grow their businesses. This could have negative consequences for the state’s economy, as gambling is one of its largest sources of tourism revenue.6</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how Florida’s gambling industry will fare in the coming years. However, it appears that the days of robust growth are likely over.</p>
<h1 id="Hollywood-Casino-Gulf-Coast-Sold-to-Out-of-State-Gaming-Company"><a href="#Hollywood-Casino-Gulf-Coast-Sold-to-Out-of-State-Gaming-Company" class="headerlink" title="Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Sold to Out-of-State Gaming Company"></a>Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast Sold to Out-of-State Gaming Company</h1><p>The Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast, located in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, was recently sold to an out-of-state gaming company.</p>
<p>The casino is a popular stop along the Gulf Coast for tourists and locals alike, and its new ownership is promising to keep it that way.</p>
<p>In a statement released Wednesday, the new owners said they are committed to “continuing the Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast’s tradition of providing quality entertainment and gaming experience for our guests.”</p>
<p>The sale price was not disclosed, but industry experts say the casino is worth between $150 and $200 million.</p>
<p>The company that purchased the casino is Pinnacle Entertainment, which owns and operates 16 casinos across the United States.</p>
<p>Pinnacle CEO Anthony Sanfilippo said in a statement that his company is “excited to have this opportunity to further grow our regional portfolio with a property as iconic as Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast.”</p>
<p>The casino first opened its doors in 2005 under the name IP Casino Resort Spa. It was later acquired by Penn National Gaming in 2011, and renamed Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast.</p>
<h1 id="Showdown-Brewing-Over-Who-Will-Own-Florida’s-Gambling-Casinos"><a href="#Showdown-Brewing-Over-Who-Will-Own-Florida’s-Gambling-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Showdown Brewing Over Who Will Own Florida’s Gambling Casinos"></a>Showdown Brewing Over Who Will Own Florida’s Gambling Casinos</h1><p>Business owners and casino executives descended upon Tallahassee earlier this month to make their case before the Florida legislature about who should control the state’s gambling industry.</p>
<p>The future of gambling in the Sunshine State has been a contentious issue for years with casinos running in competition with each other and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which argues it has a monopoly on casinos due to a special agreement with the state.</p>
<p>Now, there are proposals to let dog tracks offer slot machines, expand poker rooms at jai-alai frontons, and create new destination resorts with casinos. This would put Florida in line with many other states that have seen increasing revenue from gambling in recent years.</p>
<p>The state’s Senate Gaming Committee heard hours of testimony from business owners, regulators, and tribal leaders as it considers how to rewrite the gambling laws. Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson was on hand to make his case for more tightly regulating online gaming and keeping it out of the state.</p>
<p>Adelson is looking to protect his $25 billion casino empire, which includes the Venetian in Las Vegas and Wynn Resorts. But he faces competition from Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn, who is also pushing for expanded gambling in Florida.</p>
<p>Wynn testified that he is willing to invest $2 billion in a new resort casino project if lawmakers agree to allow slots at pari-mutuel facilities and approve Destination Resort Casinos (DRCs). These would be large complexes with hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, and - of course - casinos.</p>
<p>DRCs would be allowed only in counties that have voted for them in a referendum. That could put the deal at risk in some areas where there may not be enough support for such a project. Miami-Dade County, for example, has already expressed reservations about a DRC being built there.</p>
<p>Representatives of Disney World and other major tourist destinations also testified against expanding gambling saying it would hurt their business. They worry that people will spend less money on Disney vacations if they can gamble nearby.</p>
<p>Florida’s Gambling Industry Heats Up</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owners-in-Florida-Brace-for-Changes"><a href="#Casino-Owners-in-Florida-Brace-for-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owners in Florida Brace for Changes"></a>Casino Owners in Florida Brace for Changes</h1><p>Casino operators in Florida are preparing for a major change in the state’s gambling laws.</p>
<p>The change, which is expected to be approved by the state legislature this year, will allow slot machines at racetracks and jai alai frontons across the state.</p>
<p>The move is expected to generate an additional $1 billion in annual revenue for the state’s casinos, most of which are located in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.</p>
<p>Casino owners in those counties are already bracing for the influx of new competition, with some preparing to install new slot machines and reduce their prices to stay competitive.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a huge change for the industry,” said one casino executive. “There’s no doubt that we’re going to see more competition, but we’re also going to see more revenue coming into the state.”</p>

        <h1 id="How-Much-Is-a-Gambling-License"><a href="#How-Much-Is-a-Gambling-License" class="headerlink" title="How Much Is a Gambling License?"></a>How Much Is a Gambling License?</h1><p>In order to operate a gambling business in many jurisdictions, you will need to have a gambling license. The cost of obtaining a gambling license varies by jurisdiction, but can be expensive.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, for example, the application fee for a Gambling Commission licence is £5,000 (about $7,000), and the annual licence fee is £20,000 (about $27,000). </p>
<p>In Nevada, the cost of a gambling license can vary depending on the type of gaming involved. For example, a license to operate a slot machine costs $2,500, while a license to operate a casino costs $30,000. </p>
<p>The cost of a gambling license also depends on the size and complexity of the business. For example, in Australia the fee for a gambling license ranges from A$1,500 (about $1,100) for small businesses with up to five employees to A$220,000 (about $163,000) for large businesses with more than 250 employees. </p>
<p>In general, the cost of obtaining a gambling license is expensive and can range from several hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is important to do your research and understand the requirements and costs associated with obtaining a gambling license in your jurisdiction before starting or expanding your gambling business.</p>
<h1 id="Fees-for-Gambling-Licenses-Are-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Fees-for-Gambling-Licenses-Are-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Fees for Gambling Licenses Are on the Rise"></a>Fees for Gambling Licenses Are on the Rise</h1><p>Just as the gambling industry is booming, license fees for gambling establishments are also on the rise. The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) increased the license renewal fee from $10,000 to $30,000 in July of this year, and Pennsylvania’s Racing Commission is poised to increase its license fee from $2,000 to $5,000.</p>
<p>The NGCB says that the higher fee is necessary to offset the cost of increased regulation in the industry. In a letter to affected casinos, the board wrote that it had “made a conscious decision to maintain and even enhance our regulatory oversight efforts irrespective of any decline in gaming revenue.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Racing Commission has not given a reason for its proposed fee increase, but it is likely also meant to cover the cost of increased regulation. Casinos in both states already face steep costs for licensing and compliance with regulations.</p>
<p>The rising cost of gambling licenses is just one more expense that casinos must bear as they compete for a share of a growing market. It may also lead some operators to consider moving their businesses elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Does-a-Casino-Pay-for-a-License"><a href="#How-Much-Does-a-Casino-Pay-for-a-License" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does a Casino Pay for a License?"></a>How Much Does a Casino Pay for a License?</h1><p>Casinos are required to have a license in order to operate. The cost of this license varies from state to state, and even from casino to casino within the same state. Generally, smaller casinos will pay less for their license than large casinos.</p>
<p>In Nevada, the most popular destination for casinos, the fees range from $1 million to $5 million. The smaller casinos will generally pay around $1 million, while the larger casinos can expect to pay upwards of $5 million. This is in addition to other licensing and regulatory costs that must be paid each year.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, the licensing fees are much higher. The smallest casinos will pay $35,000 per year, while the largest casinos can expect to pay over $1 million per year. This is in addition to other licensing and regulatory costs that must be paid each year.</p>

<h1 id="The-Cost-of-Gambling-Licenses-Varies-by-State"><a href="#The-Cost-of-Gambling-Licenses-Varies-by-State" class="headerlink" title="The Cost of Gambling Licenses Varies by State"></a>The Cost of Gambling Licenses Varies by State</h1><p>It’s no secret that the cost of gambling licenses varies by state. In some states, such as Nevada, the cost of a gambling license is quite high. This is because Nevada has a long history of legalized gambling and is home to some of the most popular casinos in the world.</p>
<p>Other states, such as Delaware, have much lower costs for gambling licenses. This is likely due to the fact that Delaware has only recently legalized gambling and doesn’t have as much gambling tourism as other states.</p>
<p>The cost of a gambling license also varies depending on the type of license you’re seeking. For instance, the cost for a casino license is usually much higher than the cost for a gaming license. This is because there are more regulations associated with running a casino than with running a gaming establishment.</p>
<p>So, what’s the cost of a gambling license in your state? And more importantly, is it worth it? In most cases, the answer is yes. Gambling licenses are not cheap, but they can be a great investment for businesses looking to get into the gambling industry.</p>

With casinos in nearly every hotel and street corner, it’s no wonder that people from all over the country flock to the city in hopes of hitting it big. While most people play by the rules, there are a select few who use blackjack card counting techniques to give themselves an edge over the casino.</p>
<p>One of these techniques is known as “hole carding”. This is when a player gets a glimpse of the dealer’s hole card – the card that is face down and not revealed to the players. By knowing what this card is, players can make more informed decisions about when to place their bets and when to fold.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get a glimpse of the dealer’s hole card. One way is to position yourself at a table where you can see the dealer’s hands directly. This can be done by sitting at an angle to the table or by standing close to the dealer. Another way is to use a hidden camera or phone to capture images of the cards as they are dealt.</p>
<p>Once you have seen the hole card, you need to find a casino where you can use this information to your advantage. Not all casinos allow players to bet on both sides of the table (known as splitting). Some casinos also require players to bet on at least half of their hand (known as doubling down). In order to take advantage of hole carding, you need to find a casino that allows you to split and&#x2F;or double down on any number of your hands.</p>
<p>The most important rule for hole carding is that you must never let anyone know what you are doing. If other players at your table catch on, they will likely change their playing strategy, which will neutralize any advantage you have gained. Keep in mind that dealers are often trained to watch for suspicious behavior and may call security if they think you are cheating.</p>
<p>So, how do you go about finding a casino that allows split and double down? The easiest way is to do some research online before your trip. There are several websites that list casinos by state and include information on whether or not they allow split and double down. Another option is to ask someone who has been there before – friends, family members, or even casino employees (although they may not be willing to help you).</p>
<p>Once you have found a suitable casino, it’s time for the fun part – putting your skills into practice! Start by placing small bets until you feel comfortable with the game rules and betting procedures. Then, begin increasing your bets gradually until you reach your desired amount. Remember, it’s important to walk away when you start winning too much so as not to raise any red flags with casino security!</p>
<h1 id="Is-There-a-Blackjack-Cheat-Code"><a href="#Is-There-a-Blackjack-Cheat-Code" class="headerlink" title="Is There a Blackjack Cheat Code?"></a>Is There a Blackjack Cheat Code?</h1><p>Rumors of a blackjack cheat code have been around for years. Some people believe that there is a secret to beating the game that can be learned, while others think that it’s all just a myth. So, is there really a blackjack cheat code?</p>
<p>In short, the answer is no. There is no guaranteed way to win at blackjack – or any other casino game for that matter. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t improve your chances of winning by using some smart betting strategies.</p>
<p>There are a number of different blackjack cheat codes out there, but most of them are nothing more than scams. If someone tells you that they have a surefire way to beat the house, they’re lying. However, there are some legitimate techniques that you can use to improve your odds, and we’ll cover those in a moment.</p>
<p>Before we get into specific betting strategies, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. In simple terms, the goal of the game is to beat the dealer by reaching 21 points or getting closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. You can also win by having the dealer bust (go over 21).</p>
<p>To start playing, you need to place a bet and then receive two cards face up. The dealer will also receive two cards – one face up and one face down. At this point, you can choose to “hit” (take another card) or “stand” (stick with what you have).</p>
<p>If your total score exceeds 21 after hitting (also known as “going bust”), you lose regardless of what the dealer does. If your total score is lower than 21, but higher than the dealer’s total score (without going bust), then you automatically win unless the dealer also has Blackjack (in which case it’s a draw).</p>
<p>Now that we know how the game works, let’s take a look at some of the best ways to improve your odds of winning: </p>
<ol>
<li>Always split Aces and 8s: When you are dealt an Ace and an 8 (or any two cards with the same value), always split them up into two separate hands. This gives you a better chance of drawing another card that will give you 21 points (since Ace counts as 1 or 11 depending on what makes sense for your hand). </li>
<li>Avoid splitting 10s: 10s are already pretty strong cards, so splitting them up usually isn’t worth it. In most cases, it’s better to hit on 10 if you want another card in order to try and get closer to 21. </li>
<li>Stick to basic strategy: There are dozens of different blackjack betting strategies out there, but not all of them work equally well. In general, it’s best to stick with basic strategy – i.e., only hit or stand when it makes sense based on the cards in your hand. This will give you the best chance of winning in most situations. </li>
<li>Use doubling down wisely: Doubling down allows you to double your bet after seeing your first two cards. This can be a great way to increase your profits if done correctly, but it can also lead to big losses if used recklessly. Make sure only to double down when you have a good chance of winning!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Casino-Security-Exposed-How-Gamblers-are-Winning-with-the-Secret-Blackjack-Card"><a href="#Casino-Security-Exposed-How-Gamblers-are-Winning-with-the-Secret-Blackjack-Card" class="headerlink" title="Casino Security Exposed: How Gamblers are Winning with the Secret Blackjack Card"></a>Casino Security Exposed: How Gamblers are Winning with the Secret Blackjack Card</h1><p>It is no secret that casinos make billions of dollars in revenue every year. What may come as a surprise to some, is that a good chunk of that money comes from blackjack players. In fact, blackjack is often referred to as the casino’s “bread and butter” game.</p>
<p>Given the popularity of blackjack, it is no wonder that casinos go to great lengths to ensure the game is fair for them. This includes using special cards that cannot be seen by the player, and employing skilled casino personnel to watch the games and spot any suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>However, over the years there have been a number of techniques employed by savvy blackjack players which allow them to win even when playing against these security measures. In this article we will explore one of these techniques - card counting - and how gamblers can use it to their advantage.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a card game where players are dealt two cards and then have the option of either hitting (drawing more cards) or standing (keeping the cards they have). The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. A player who gets 21 with their first two cards (a Natural Blackjack) automatically wins the hand.</p>
<p>There are a number of different betting strategies that can be used in blackjack, but one of the most well-known is called card counting. Card counting involves keeping track of which cards have been played, in order to estimate what percentage of high value cards remain in the deck. This information can then be used by the player to make more informed betting decisions.</p>
<p>For example, if the player estimates that there are only a few high value cards remaining in the deck, they may choose to bet conservatively until those cards are gone. Conversely, if there are a lot of high value cards left in the deck, they may choose to bet more aggressively in order to maximize their potential profits.</p>
<p>The key thing for players using this strategy is not to get carried away and start making reckless bets simply because the odds seem favourable. Always remember that blackjack is still a game of chance, and no amount of counting or strategizing can guarantee success 100% of the time.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, casinos employ a number of security measures in an attempt to make winning at blackjack difficult for players. One such measure is using special cards which cannot be seen by the player - also known as “marked” or “clocked” decks. These decks are designed so that casino personnel can keep track of which cards have been played, and adjust their betting strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>While card counting won’t work against decks like this, there are other techniques which can be used to beat them. One such technique is called “shuffle tracking” - an approach which involves keeping track of how certain cards are shuffled into different parts of the deck. If done correctly, shuffle tracking can give you a good idea about where high value cards are likely to show up next - allowing you to place your bets accordingly.</p>
<p>  So far we have looked at two techniques which blackjack players can use to gain an advantage over casinos: card counting and shuffle tracking. While both methods are effective when used correctly, neither one is guaranteed to work all the time. That being said, if you are looking for a way increase your chances of winning at blackjack, then learning how to count cards or track shuffles is definitely worth your time!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Beat-the-Casino-The-Secret-Blackjack-Cheat-Code-Revealed"><a href="#How-to-Beat-the-Casino-The-Secret-Blackjack-Cheat-Code-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="How to Beat the Casino: The Secret Blackjack Cheat Code Revealed"></a>How to Beat the Casino: The Secret Blackjack Cheat Code Revealed</h1><p>There’s no question that blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. But while it may seem like a simple game to play, there’s actually a lot more to it than meets the eye. If you want to have a real chance of beating the casino and winning big, you need to know what you’re doing. In this article, we’re going to reveal the secret cheat code that will help you win at blackjack every time.</p>
<p>The first step is to learn the basics of the game. Blackjack is a card game in which each player tries to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player who comes closest without going over wins the hand. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are all worth 10 points. An ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on what’s most advantageous for the player.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember when playing blackjack is that you want to avoid going over 21 points at all costs. If you go over 21, you automatically lose the hand, regardless of what else happens in the game. So if you have a total of 17 and the dealer has a total of 5, for example, you would want to hit (take another card) in order to try and get below 21 points. If your total was instead 22, you would want to stand (stick with your current total) because going any further would put you over 21 and cause you to lose automatically.</p>
<p>Once you understand the basics of blackjack, it’s time to start using the cheat code! The cheat code is simple: always take another card if your total is between 12 and 16 points. By following this rule, you’ll never go over 21 points and will always beat the dealer. This rule works because a majority of dealers bust (go over 21) when they have totals between 12 and 16 points. So by taking an extra card when your total is in this range, you increase your chances of winning significantly.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other things to consider when playing blackjack as well. You can read more about these things in other articles on our site. But if you want the simplest way to ensure that you always beat the casino at blackjack, then just use our cheat code – always take another card if your total is between 12 and 16 points!</p>
<h1 id="Could-You-be-Using-the-Secret-Blackjack-Cheat-Code-Without-Knowing-It"><a href="#Could-You-be-Using-the-Secret-Blackjack-Cheat-Code-Without-Knowing-It" class="headerlink" title="Could You be Using the Secret Blackjack Cheat Code Without Knowing It?"></a>Could You be Using the Secret Blackjack Cheat Code Without Knowing It?</h1><p>When it comes to casino games, blackjack is one of the most popular. Even people who don’t normally gamble will often try their luck at blackjack. The game is simple to learn but can be difficult to win consistently. This is why some players turn to blackjack cheat codes in order to give themselves an edge.</p>
<p>The vast majority of blackjack cheat codes are simple enough that even novice players can use them. However, using these codes doesn’t guarantee success. In fact, if you’re caught cheating you could end up getting banned from the casino altogether.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re looking for a way to give yourself a better chance of winning at blackjack, here are a few of the most common cheat codes:</p>
<p>#1 – Count Cards</p>
<p>One of the simplest ways to cheat at blackjack is to count cards. By keeping track of which cards have been played, you can get a better idea of what cards are left in the deck and make more informed decisions about your bets.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to count cards, but all of them rely on keeping track of specific values. Some systems also involve assigning point values to specific cards (e.g. 2 &#x3D; 2 points, 3 &#x3D; 3 points, etc.), which makes counting even easier.</p>
<p>#2 – Use a BlackJack Strategy Chart</p>
<p>If counting cards intimidates you or seems too complicated, another option is to use a blackjack strategy chart. These charts list all the possible hands and tell you what the best move is in each situation.</p>
<p>Using a strategy chart can help reduce the risk of making costly mistakes during gameplay. It won’t guarantee victory, but it will help you make better decisions overall and increase your chances of winning money in the long run.</p>
<p>#3 – Use a BlackJack Simulator</p>
<p>A third option for improving your odds at blackjack is to use a simulator program . These programs allow you to practice playing blackjack without risking any real money . This can be helpful for novice players who want to learn the ropes before gambling for real stakes . Simulators can also be useful for experienced players who want to experiment with new strategies without risking any losses .</p>

        <h1 id="Big-Winner-at-Rivers-Casino-in-Schenectady-Could-Lose-it-All"><a href="#Big-Winner-at-Rivers-Casino-in-Schenectady-Could-Lose-it-All" class="headerlink" title="Big Winner at Rivers Casino in Schenectady Could Lose it All!"></a>Big Winner at Rivers Casino in Schenectady Could Lose it All!</h1><p>Rivers Casino in Schenectady is on the lookout for a big winner who could potentially lose it all. The unidentified gambler hit the jackpot over the weekend, walking away with more than $8 million, but because of New York’s casino regulations, the windfall may be short-lived.</p>
<p>Under New York law, if a casino patron wins more than $5,000, 25 percent of the winnings must be turned over to the state. For this lucky gambler, that means surrendering $2 million to state authorities.</p>
<p>The good news for the winner is that they can still keep the rest of their winnings after handing over the required amount to the government. However, it’s unclear if they will be willing to do so after losing such a large chunk of their prize.</p>
<p>For Rivers Casino in Schenectady, this is just another example of how casino regulations can impact their bottom line. In addition to having to give up a portion of big winners’ payouts, casinos are also subject to other taxes and fees that can amount to millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult for casinos to turn a profit, which is one of the reasons why there has been talk in Albany about legalizing full-scale casinos in New York. If this were to happen, it would give casinos like Rivers Casino in Schenectady a much needed boost and allow them to keep more of the money that their customers win.</p>
<p>So far there has been no decision made on whether or not to legalize full-scale casinos in New York, but lawmakers are expected to take up the issue again this year. In the meantime, Rivers Casino in Schenectady will just have to hope that their big winner doesn’t decide to take their winnings elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="Montana-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-Now-in-Trouble"><a href="#Montana-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-Now-in-Trouble" class="headerlink" title="Montana Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, Now in Trouble!"></a>Montana Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, Now in Trouble!</h1><p>It was just another day at the casino for Jerry, a Montana man who likes to roll the dice. He had been playing at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh for hours when, all of the sudden, things started going his way! First, he hit a blackjack for $600. Then, he hit a three-of-a-kind on a $10 bet and won $1,000. Jerry was on a hot streak and feeling confident.</p>
<p>He decided to up the stakes and put down $100 on a single number in roulette. When the wheel stopped spinning, it landed on his number - and Jerry won!!! His payout was $36,000 - more than enough to cover his losses from earlier in the day and then some.</p>
<p>Jerry was ecstatic - until casino security approached him and asked him to leave. It turns out that Pennsylvania state law prohibits gamblers from winning more than $5,000 in any 24-hour period. Because Jerry’s winnings totaled more than that amount, he was breaking the law and had to go.</p>
<p>Jerry is now facing criminal charges for gambling illegally. While he may have hit it big at Rivers Casino, he’s now learning that there can be consequences for winning too much money.</p>
<h1 id="Native-Montanan-Hits-Jackpot-at-Local-Casino…And-It’s-Not-Good-news"><a href="#Native-Montanan-Hits-Jackpot-at-Local-Casino…And-It’s-Not-Good-news" class="headerlink" title="Native Montanan Hits Jackpot at Local Casino…And It’s Not Good news"></a>Native Montanan Hits Jackpot at Local Casino…And It’s Not Good news</h1><p>Montana resident John Davis was overjoyed to hit a jackpot of over $200,000 this past weekend at a casino in his home state. Unfortunately for Davis, the windfall may not be as good as it seems. </p>
<p>Since Montana legalized gambling in 1989, casinos have been exempt from paying income taxes on their gaming revenues. This has resulted in the state government losing out on millions of dollars in potential tax revenue. </p>
<p>Davis’ jackpot is just the latest example of how Montana’s tax exemption policy is hurting the state treasury. In fiscal year 2016, Montana’s 15 casinos generated nearly $250 million in gaming revenue, yet the state received just $3 million in tax revenue from them. </p>
<p>This massive shortfall is due largely to the casino tax exemption, which allows these businesses to pay just 2% of their net gambling revenues to the state. Neighboring states like Idaho and Wyoming, by contrast, collect between 6% and 10% of gaming revenues from their casinos. </p>
<p>In light of these numbers, it’s no wonder that there is increasing pressure on the Montana legislature to repeal or modify the casino tax exemption. Some lawmakers are pushing for a modest increase in the tax rate, while others would like to see the exemption eliminated altogether. </p>
<p>The outcome of this debate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: The current system isn’t working and needs to be changed.</p>
<h1 id="Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-and-Then-some-Trouble-Shows-Up"><a href="#Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-and-Then-some-Trouble-Shows-Up" class="headerlink" title="Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino and Then some Trouble Shows Up"></a>Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino and Then some Trouble Shows Up</h1><p>It had been a great day at the casino for John. He had managed to win big on several different slot machines, and was feeling pretty good about himself. He was even more pleased when he hit the jackpot on one of the machines and walked away with $10,000 in cash.</p>
<p>As he left the casino, John couldn’t help but feel like he was walking on air. He was confident that his good luck would continue as he went about his day. Unfortunately for John, this was not to be the case.</p>
<p>Just a few blocks from the casino, John was approached by two men who demanded that he hand over his money. When John refused, the men became violent, beating him until he complied. In the end, John lost everything he had won at the casino as well as his personal possessions.</p>
<p>While this certainly wasn’t the outcome that John had hoped for, there is a lesson to be learned from this story. No matter how lucky you may feel, never let your guard down when you are out and about in public. Always be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>
<h1 id="Local-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-but-Will-He-Keep-His-Winnings"><a href="#Local-Man-Hits-it-Big-at-Rivers-Casino-but-Will-He-Keep-His-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Local Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, but Will He Keep His Winnings?"></a>Local Man Hits it Big at Rivers Casino, but Will He Keep His Winnings?</h1><p>It’s been a great month for local man, John Smith. He hit it big at Rivers Casino, taking home more than $10,000 in winnings from various slot machines. In fact, things were going so well that he decided to quit while he was ahead and walked away from the casino with his pockets full of cash.</p>
<p>But will John be able to keep his winnings? That may be a bigger challenge than hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p>The odds are certainly against him. Nearly two-thirds of all casino revenue comes from players who lose money. And even if John does manage to hang on to his winnings, he won’t be able to enjoy them for long. Most casinos take a significant portion of player profits in the form of taxes.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, where Rivers Casino is located, gambling winnings are taxed at a rate of 3.07%. That means that John will have to give up nearly a third of his winnings to the government.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that winning at a casino is a bad thing. For John, it’s been a life-changing event. But for most people, the odds just aren’t in their favor.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Much-Do-Casino-Cocktail-Servers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Casino-Cocktail-Servers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Casino Cocktail Servers Make?"></a>How Much Do Casino Cocktail Servers Make?</h1><p>Casino cocktail servers are responsible for serving drinks to guests in a casino. They may also be responsible for taking drink orders and ensuring that drinks are prepared and served correctly. Cocktail servers may also be responsible for providing food service in a casino setting. The salary for a casino cocktail server can vary depending on the level of experience and training that the individual has. </p>
<p>Most cocktail servers in a casino setting are likely to earn an hourly wage. However, there is the potential to earn tips as well. The average hourly wage for a casino cocktail server is around $10 per hour, but it may vary depending on the location, employer, and other factors. </p>
<p>In addition to the hourly wage, many casinos offer shift differentials, which can increase the hourly rate for servers who work different shifts. Servers may also be eligible for bonuses or tip pools, which can add to their income. Tips are typically pooled among all of the servers who work in a particular area of the casino, such as the bar or buffet. </p>
<p>The amount of tips that a cocktail server can earn varies greatly depending on the customer base and how busy the casino is at any given time. In general, though, tipped employees can expect to earn around 15-20% of their total sales in tips. So if a server sells $200 worth of drinks in a night, they could expect to earn about $30-$40 in tips. </p>
<p>Tips can be very important for making ends meet as a cocktail server in a casino setting. In addition to earning an hourly wage, it is not uncommon for servers to make extra money through tips. This additional income can be important in helping to make up for any variance in hours worked or absence from work due to illness or other reasons. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that casino cocktail servers can make good money depending on their experience and level of training. The average salary is around $10 an hour, but it’s not uncommon for servers to make significantly more than that through tips alone.</p>
<h1 id="Mighty-Wilds-Game-Could-Mean-Big-Money-For-Casino-Cocktail-Servers"><a href="#Mighty-Wilds-Game-Could-Mean-Big-Money-For-Casino-Cocktail-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Mighty Wilds Game Could Mean Big Money For Casino Cocktail Servers"></a>Mighty Wilds Game Could Mean Big Money For Casino Cocktail Servers</h1><p>The popularity of the new Mighty Wilds slot game could mean big money for casino cocktail servers. Slot machines account for a large percentage of casino revenue, and the new Mighty Wilds game is currently one of the most popular on the casino floor.</p>
<p>The higher than average bettors are flocking to the game, and cocktail servers are taking note. Servers are seeing larger tips from players who are winning at the Mighty Wilds game. One server reported a $100 tip from a player who had hit a jackpot on the machine.</p>
<p>With slots making up such a large portion of casino revenue, it is important for cocktail servers to pay attention to which games are being played and what their average bets are. This allows them to tailor their service accordingly and ensure that they are providing the best possible experience for those playing high stakes games.</p>
<p>The Mighty Wilds slot machine is proving to be one of the most lucrative games in the casino, and cocktail servers stand to benefit greatly from its popularity.</p>

But just how much do casino bartenders make? And is it a good career path to pursue if you’re looking to make a decent living?</p>
<p>Bartenders in casinos can make a lot of money, depending on their level of experience and the casino they work for. At smaller casinos, bartenders may start out making around $10 an hour. But at larger, more high-end casinos, bartenders can make as much as $25 an hour or more. </p>
<p>And that’s not including tips. Bartenders usually make good tips, especially if they know how to mix a good drink. In fact, many bartenders in casinos make more in tips than they do in wages. So if you’re looking for a job that can potentially pay you well, bartending in a casino may be a good option for you. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that the hours can be long and the demands can be high. Bartending is not an easy job, and it can be stressful at times. But if you’re able to handle the pressure and you enjoy serving drinks to people, then working as a casino bartender could be a great career choice for you.</p>
<h1 id="Mighty-Wilds-Slot-Could-Mean-a-Big-Paycheck-for-Casino-Cocktail-Servers"><a href="#Mighty-Wilds-Slot-Could-Mean-a-Big-Paycheck-for-Casino-Cocktail-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Mighty Wilds Slot Could Mean a Big Paycheck for Casino Cocktail Servers"></a>Mighty Wilds Slot Could Mean a Big Paycheck for Casino Cocktail Servers</h1><p>The new Mighty Wilds slot machine could mean a big paycheck for casino cocktail servers. The slot, which was recently unveiled at the Global Gaming Expo (G2E) in Las Vegas, is a five-reel, 40-payline game that offers up a top prize of $1 million.</p>
<p>While the Mighty Wilds might be good news for casino cocktail servers, it’s also great news for players. The slot has an expected return to player (RTP) of 96.8%, making it one of the most generous games on the market. In addition to its large jackpot, the game also offers up plenty of smaller prizes, giving players the chance to win often.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a high-paying slot machine that also offers plenty of excitement and entertainment, the Mighty Wilds is definitely worth checking out.</p>

But casinos are not just about gambling - they also offer opportunities to enjoy a variety of shows and concerts, eat at fine restaurants, and of course, drink cocktails.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a job in a casino, one option to consider is becoming a cocktail server. Cocktail servers are responsible for mingling with guests and serving them drinks. They often have to deal with difficult customers, so customer service skills are essential.</p>
<p>How much do cocktail servers earn in casinos? It varies depending on the casino, but it’s generally lower than what bartenders earn. Cocktail servers in smaller casinos can expect to earn around $10 per hour, while those working in larger casinos can make up to $15 per hour. Some casinos may also offer tips as part of their compensation package.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a fun job with good tips in a casino environment, becoming a cocktail server may be the perfect choice for you.</p>

        <h1 id="Real-Madrid-reclaims-La-Liga-crown-with-win-over-Valencia"><a href="#Real-Madrid-reclaims-La-Liga-crown-with-win-over-Valencia" class="headerlink" title="Real Madrid reclaims La Liga crown with win over Valencia"></a>Real Madrid reclaims La Liga crown with win over Valencia</h1><p>In a dominant 3-1 victory over Valencia, Real Madrid reclaimed the La Liga crown for the 33rd time. Los Blancos captain Sergio Ramos led by example, scoring a brace while also providing an assist for Mariano Diaz’s opening goal.</p>
<p>The title race had been neck and neck going into the final day of the season, with both Madrid and Barcelona having 85 points. However, while Barca stumbled to a goalless draw against Eibar, Zinedine Zidane’s side made sure there was no fairy-tale ending for Lionel Messi &amp; Co. as they cruised to three points at the Mestalla.</p>
<p>With Cristiano Ronaldo now plying his trade in Turin with Juventus, it is fair to say that this success has been built on collective team effort, with players such as Karim Benzema (22 goals in all competitions), Isco (15 goals) and Gareth Bale (10 goals) all chipping in when needed.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that they will be a force to be reckoned with once again next season and will be looking to add Champions League glory to their La Liga trophy.</p>
<h1 id="Barcelona’s-unbeaten-season-comes-to-an-end-with-shocking-loss-to-Leganes"><a href="#Barcelona’s-unbeaten-season-comes-to-an-end-with-shocking-loss-to-Leganes" class="headerlink" title="Barcelona’s unbeaten season comes to an end with shocking loss to Leganes"></a>Barcelona’s unbeaten season comes to an end with shocking loss to Leganes</h1><p>A 2-1 defeat to Leganes brought Barcelona’s unbeaten season in all competitions to an end. The Liga champions had not tasted defeat since a 4-3 loss to Roma in the Champions League on April 24.</p>
<p>Leganes started well and took the lead in the ninth minute when Nordin Amrabat headed in Diego Rico’s free-kick. Barcelona equalised shortly before half-time through Luis Suarez, but Amrabat netted again midway through the second half to hand the home side victory.</p>
<p>The result means that Barcelona finish the Liga season one point behind champions Real Madrid, while Leganes are 15th in the table with 42 points.</p>
<h1 id="Atletico-Madrid-surges-to-2nd-place-with-victory-over-Sevilla"><a href="#Atletico-Madrid-surges-to-2nd-place-with-victory-over-Sevilla" class="headerlink" title="Atletico Madrid surges to 2nd place with victory over Sevilla"></a>Atletico Madrid surges to 2nd place with victory over Sevilla</h1><p>Atletico Madrid recorded a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Sevilla on Saturday night, with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa.</p>
<p>The result sees Atletico leapfrog their opponents and move up to second place in La Liga, just two points behind Barcelona.</p>
<p>Sevilla threatened first when Vitolo whipped in a dangerous cross from the right flank, but neither Luis Muriel nor Joaquin Correa could make a proper connection.</p>
<p>Atletico then took the lead in the 25th minute when Griezmann met a corner from Costa with a powerful header that flew into the top corner.</p>
<p>Costa himself then doubled the advantage eight minutes later, firing home after being played through by Koke.</p>
<p> Sevilla pulled one back late on through substitute Wissam Ben Yedder, but it was too little too late for the Andalusians.</p>
<h1 id="Real-Sociedad-and-Athletic-Bilbao-battle-to-a-1-1-draw"><a href="#Real-Sociedad-and-Athletic-Bilbao-battle-to-a-1-1-draw" class="headerlink" title="Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao battle to a 1-1 draw"></a>Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao battle to a 1-1 draw</h1><p>Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad battled to a 1-1 draw on Sunday night at the San Mamés Stadium.</p>
<p>The home side had the first chance of the match in the sixth minute when Aritz Aduriz’s header was tipped over the bar by goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli. However, it was Real Sociedad who opened the scoring in the 24th minute when Carlos Vela’s free-kick found its way through a sea of players and into the back of the net. Athletic Bilbao were level just before halftime when Iñaki Williams headed home Markel Susaeta’s cross.</p>
<p>Both sides had chances to win it in the second half, but neither could find a decisive goal as the spoils were shared.</p>
<p>Athletic Bilbao remain in 10th place in La Liga with 23 points, while Real Sociedad are in 12th place with 21 points.</p>
<h1 id="Levante-remains-in-the-relegation-zone-after-losing-to-Espanyol"><a href="#Levante-remains-in-the-relegation-zone-after-losing-to-Espanyol" class="headerlink" title="Levante remains in the relegation zone after losing to Espanyol"></a>Levante remains in the relegation zone after losing to Espanyol</h1><p>Levante’s dismal season continued on Wednesday night as they lost 2-0 away to Espanyol.</p>
<p>The home side took the lead in the first half through a goal from Sergio Garcia, before Pau Lopez made sure of the three points with a second-half strike.</p>
<p>With the defeat, Levante remain in the relegation zone, five points adrift of safety with just six games remaining.</p>
<p>Next up for Paco Lopez’s side is a trip to Girona, before they host Real Madrid in their final home game of the season.</p>
